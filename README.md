# Matrices in C++

Yet another C++ implementation of matrix operations, with multithreading. Is a learning project. It uses the threadpool I made, which can be found [here](https://github.com/abhikjain360/threadpool).

Still WIP. Currently only has basic operations defined using threadpool, but those still outperform your typical addition and subtraction.
