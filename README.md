# Matrices in C++

Ye another C++ implementation of matrix operations, with multithreading. Is a learning project. It uses the threadpool is made, which can be found [here](https://github.com/abhikjain360/threadpool).

Still WIP. Currently only has addition and substraction using threadpool, but those still outperform your typical addition and subtraction.
